NHTSA UDS Library

The UDS library is a collection of routines to support the i/o and processing
of NHTSA UDS-1992 format data files.  It contains both UDS-specific and
common general-purpose routines used by NHTSA applications.

The top-level UDS library directory contains the routines considered fully
portable across platforms.  Subdirectories for each supported platform
contain platform-specific routines, makefiles, and header files.  Header
files are located in INC subdirectories of the tree.  Compiler and make
path searching should be used to first search the platform-specific
directory and then the shared code directory to get the appropriate source
file.

The portable code and most of the platform-specific code is written in
Fortran 77 (using some common extensions such as DO-ENDDO and STRUCTURE).
C routines are used where necessary to facilitate low-level i/o
operations.  The usage documentation for each routine is contained in its
source code header comment.  Support for additional platforms can be added
by following this framework.  NHTSA welcomes contributions of additional
platform support files.

The common UDS_STR.FI header file has STRUCTURE declarations that are not
naturally aligned.  The FILE.FI header is naturally aligned to 4-byte
boundaries.  On platforms supporting it, the best approach is to
make a platform-specific header files that include the common headers inside
wrapper directives to ensure the desired alignment.  Otherwise it is possible
for user code to be compiled with different alignment than the Tools library
causing run-time errors.  If such directives are not supported then the
proper alignment compile settings should be prominently documented.
