		NHTSA Tools Source Code Documentation


The NHTSA Tools software is based on a portable Fortran framework with a
small set of platform-specific routines and header files.  The Tools
library has been built to provide high functionality in the programs
without great complexity.

Currently Windows, OpenVMS, and a number of Unix platforms are supported.
Most of the code is Fortran 77.  Fortran 77 compilers that support
STRUCTURE, DO WHILE / END DO, and some other common extensions are
required.  A few C routines are used where necessary on some platforms.
The programs run in console mode for portability except for
platform-specific graphics programs.

The source code resides in directory trees with the cross-platform source
and header files above platform subdirectories with platform-specific
files.  The platform-specific sources and headers must be customized for
each new platform-compiler combination.  Search paths for source and
header files should be set to look first in the platform-specific source
or include subdirectory, and then in the cross-platform directory.
