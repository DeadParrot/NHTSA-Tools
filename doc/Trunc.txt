PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	Trunc performs user-requested truncation or extension and subsampling
	of UDS files.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	Either or both data tails can be truncated or extended (with zeros)
	and subsampling can be performed.

	A report file named trunc.rep is generated if the REP command line
	argument is used.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing UDS time series file must be supplied to the program.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	The data array index is limited by the bounds of the Trunc array
	program.

	Trunc does not perform domain shifting of the pulse (the alignment is
	not changed, the tail lengths are just adjusted).  Use UDSTool or other
	programs to perform domain shifting.

	Subsampling of data is not recommended, in general.  Unless the
	sampling frequency is at least twice the stop frequency of the filter
	(the Nyquist frequency) information will be lost.  It is better to
	filter to an appropriate frequency before increasing the time increment
	in the pulse.
