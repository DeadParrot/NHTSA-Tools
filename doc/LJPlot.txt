PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	LJPlot plots overlays of UDS and ASCII files on HP LaserJet III and
	above (PCL5) compatible printers in 300 or 600 dpi resolution.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	Up to 20 overlayed curves can be put on each plot.  Plot symbols are
	provided for overlay plots. When the input file contains the relevant
	information, axis labels are created automatically. The user is
	prompted for unknown labels.

	Plots are done in 300 dpi resolution unless the "600" command line
	switch is used (600 dpi must be supported by the printer).

	Both the X and Y axes can be manually scaled and log transformed.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	UDS files with Y series or X-Y data are supported. UDS plot overlays
	are automatically converted to the dimensional system of the first
	curve, if necessary.  With UDS files, LJPlot displays summary
	information for each curve below its file name.

	ASCII files must have two columns of numbers, with the x-axis value
	followed by the corresponding y-axis value on each line (separated by
	spaces, tabs, and/or a comma). Non-numeric header records may precede
	the columns of numbers.

	In addition to the standard command line switches LJPlot accepts
	the switches:

	  LJPlot [NPER=<num_per>] [X=LOG] [Y=LOG]
	         [600] [LINE=<thickness>] [NO_SYM] [MF] [PRN=<prn_dev>]

	with the meanings:

	         <num_per> :  Number of curves per plot [all (max 20)]
	         X/Y=LOG :  Use logarithmic X/Y axis
	         600 :  600 dpi resolution
	         <thickness> :  Line thickness (0,1,2,...) [1]
	         NO_SYM :  No plot symbols
	         MF :  Manual feed
	         <prn_dev> :  Printer device [LPT1]

	LJPlot determines the type of file, UDS or ASCII, automatically
	(different types can be combined on the same plot).  If the X or Y
	units of overlayed files are inconsistent, LJPlot turns on the
	unitless plot mode for the corresponding axis.  Unitless axes have no
	units or values and all curves are expanded to full range.  Unitless
	mode can also be turned on or off manually. Log transform modes can
	also be set while running LJPlot and remain set for subsequent plots.
