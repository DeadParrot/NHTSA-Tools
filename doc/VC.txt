PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	VC computes the Viscous Criterion for side impacted occupants.  VC is
	an injury criterion proposed by General Motors for evaluating thoracic
	impact trauma.

	The VC program should be ONLY used for side impacted occupants.
	This program is inappropriate for frontally impacted occupants.

	The VC program first computes the filtered chest compression Cf(t) by
	filtering the raw chest compression using a four pole phaseless
	Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz.  The velocity
	Vf(t) is computed by taking the derivative of the filtered compression,
	and filtering it using a four pole phaseless Butterworth filter with a
	cutoff frequency of 100 Hz.

	VC(t) is computed by multiplying the velocity Vf(t) by the filtered
	chest compression Cf(t), and dividing by 174.5 mm (half standard chest
	width).  The units of VC(t) are meters/sec.

	The VC value reported by this program is the maximum of VC(t) over the
	time interval of the input compression signal.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	The VC program outputs a summary of results to the screen and
	optionally (using the REP command line argument) to the report file
	vc.rep.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing chest compression time series file in UDS format must be
	supplied to the program.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	The VC program should ONLY be used for side impacted occupants.
	This program is inappropriate for frontally impacted occupants.
