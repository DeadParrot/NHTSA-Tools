PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	UDS2Y converts UDS X-Y files into y-series UDS files.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	Either axis of an X-Y file can be used for the output y-axis
	data, and it can be interpolated over the other input axis or
	each point output with time or frequency used as the output
	x-axis data type (assuming the data corresponded to an even
	time or frequency step).

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing UDS X-Y file must be supplied to the program.
	UDS2Y prompts for the data to use for the output y and x-axes.
	For interpolated, Y(x) or X(y), output a step value is also
	prompted for.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	For interpolated, Y(x) or X(y), outputs UDS2Y starts at the
	first data point and produces evenly spaced outputs until the
	independent axis, (x) or (y), data reverses direction, if ever.
	If this fails to capture the region of interest in a multi-valued
	X-Y file preprocess the input with a program such as Trunc to
	isolate an enclosing region of monotonic independent axis data.
