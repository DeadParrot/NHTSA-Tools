PROGRAM: HIC				PROGRAM MODIFICATION DATE:  2003/07/28

AUTHOR:  Stuart G. Mentzer

PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	HIC finds the maximum Head Injury Criterion (HIC) value of a head cg
	resultant acceleration time seies and the corresponding time interval.
	The HIC value is the integral of the acceleration (in G'S) to the 2.5
	power divided by the time interval to the 1.5 power.

	HIC uses an efficient branch and bound algorithm which finds the
	global maximum while exploiting the monotonicities within the HIC
        function.

	See report DOT-HS-806-681 for a description of the basic algorithm.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	A new version of the UDS file with the computed HIC value is output
	to the user's account if requested with the UPDATE command line
	argument.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing resultant time series must be supplied to the program.
	If the data isn't raw head cg acceleration a warning is produced.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	None.
