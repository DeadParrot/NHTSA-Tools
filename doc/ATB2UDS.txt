PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	The ATB2UDS program extracts motion and force histories from ATB output
	(CVS version 4.2) and writes those to UDS files.

	The program inputs the post-processing time history data file (FORTRAN
	unit No.  8) which can be output by ATB.  The generation of this file by
	ATB is controlled by the value of NPRT(4) on ATB input card A.5.  A
	postive value of +1 to +4 will result in the above file being output.

	Please refer to pp.  30-31 and 90-93 of the ATB (CVS) User's Manual
	(VOLUME III) for more detail on the generation and use of the ATB output
	post-processing time history data file.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	ATB2UDS is basically a conversion program.  It acquires the AVAILABLE
	information, regarding the time histories, from the ATB output file and
	writes it to UDS files.

	ATB2UDS Options
	---------------

	The program provides UDS file output of the following time histories as
	acquired from the ATB output file :

	o  linear accelerations :  components and resultant of linear
	                           acceleration (in local segment
	                           reference) for points on segments -
	                           (as specified by ATB input cards H.1)

	o  linear velocities :     components and resultant of linear
	                           velocities (in vehicle reference) -
	                           (as specified by ATB input cards H.2)

	o  linear displacements    components and resultant of linear
	                           positions (in vehicle reference)for points
	                           on segments - (as specified by ATB input
	                           cards H.3)

	o  angular accelerations   components and resultant of angular
	                           accelerations (in local segment reference)
	                           for segments - (as specified by ATB input
	                           cards H.4)

	o  angular velocities      components and resultant of angular
	                           velocities (in vehicle reference) for
	                           segments - (as specified by ATB input
	                           cards H.5)

	o  angular displacements   components and resultant of angular
	                           rotations (in vehicle reference)
	                           for segments - (as specified by ATB input
	                           cards H.6)

	0  plane forces            contact forces for the allowed contacts
	                           between planes and segments - (as
	                           specified by ATB input cards F.1)

	--------------------------- NOTE --------------------------------------
	The plane forces, for the allowed contacts, are ALWAYS available in the
	ATB post-processing file; while the motion histories are optional and
	are only available if requested on ATB input cards H.1 through H.6.
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	ATB2UDS Features
	----------------

	1. HEADER INFORMATION

	The following variables are set for each curve (history) in an output
	UDS file :

	  - TSTPRF
	  - TSTSRC
	  - TSTREF (** This is set to the first 10 characters of the ATB
	    run description as entered on card A.2, to map the UDS files
	    with the specific ATB run)
	  - TSTNAM (** This is input by the user to qualify a given ATB run.)
	  - CURNAM
	  - CURTYP
	  - SENATT
	  - AXIS
	  - YTYP, YUNITS, XTYP, XUNITS
	  - NFP
	  - NLP
	  - DEL
	  - STATUS
	  - RD1, RD2, and RD3 (set to co-ordinates of the point on a given
	    segment for which linear motion histories are output)
	  - CURDSC

	2. OUTPUT DATA SAMPLING RATE (DEL)

	The time interval for data output, DT (as specified by the ATB input
	card A.4), is not available from the ATB output file.  ATB2DUS computes
	the smallest time interval at which data is available and outputs the
	corresponding number of points to the UDS files.  Thus, it is possible
	to get a finer sampling of the data then specified by DT as ATB can
	output the data at the end of each successful integration step (See
	specification of ATB input NPRT(26) card A.5).

	To control the amount of printout from a regular ATB run but still
	obtain a fine sampling of the histories, through UDS files from ATB2UDS,
	you can specify a large value for DT relative to HMAX (on ATB input card
	A.4) while specifying NPRT(4)=2 or 3 and NPRT(26)=0 (on ATB input card
	A.5).

	3. UDS OUTPUT FILES NOMENCLATURE

	The UDS output files are named Snnnnaa0b.mmm  such that:

		nnnn :==   the value of TSTNAM as entered by the user
		            to qualify the given ATB run

		aa   :==   AC, VC, DC, FC  corresponding to a computed
		           acceleration, velocity, displacement or
		           force history

		b    :==   X , Y, Z and R for x, y, z components and
		           resultant of the motion histories  OR
		           P for the plane forces histories

		mmm  :==   sequential curve number to uniquely qualify
		           each history (i.e. each output UDS file)



	4.  ATB2UDS OUTPUT LISTING FILE

	The program generates a listing file, called ATB2UDS.OUT, which contains
	the names of the output UDS files and a description of their content.


SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	The following inputs are required:

	1. ATB output file name

	2. An ATB run number, up to 4 digits (to be placed the UDS file TSTNAM
	   field and will be part of the UDS file names)


KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	In addition to the above histories the ATB (unit 8) output file also
	contains, if available from the simulated model, the following
	histories:

	o  joint parameters :-
	                  the lock condition, angles and torques for joints
	                  (as specified by input cards H.7)

	o  belt forces :- strain and anchor point forces for the allowed
	                  contacts between belts and segments (as specified
	                  by input cards F.2)

	o  harness-belt forces :-
	                  strain and endpoint forces for all belt sections
	                  of the harness belts (from points specified as
	                  endpoints on input cards F.8.d)

	o  spring damper forces :-
	                  (as specified by input cards D.8)

	o  segment contact forces :-
	                  contact forces for the allowed contacts between
	                  segments and other segments (as specified by input
	                  cards F.3)

	o  airbag forces :-
	                  airbag parameters and contact forces for the
	                  allowed contacts between airbags and segments
	                  (as specified by input cards F.6)

	If the need arises, a future upgrade of ATB2UDS can be provided to write
	these histories to UDS file format.

	***********************************************************************
	*******************************  NOTE *********************************

	In future versions of ATB(CVS), there is a possibility that the
	contents of the post-processing time history data file may be CHANGED!
	Thus the ATB2UDS program MUST be changed accordingly!! The routines that
	control/designate the output of the time histories in the ATB program
	are OUTPUT and HEDING.
