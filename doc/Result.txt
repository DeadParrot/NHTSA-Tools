PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	Result computes the resultant of orthogonal axis UDS y-series files.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	Resultants can be computed from one, two, or three distinct axis files.
	The AXIS field of the output file is set to RS if different axes are
	used.  The CURNAM is set to RES followed by letter indicating the axes
	used.

	Consistency checking is performed to warn the user if certain key
	fields are not the same in the input files. Some of the fields must be
	consistent or an error is generated. Other fields are blanked or set
	to zero if an inconsistency is present.

	The output array dimensions are the intersection of the input file
	ranges.

	A report file named result.rep is generated if the REP command line
	argument is used.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	Existing UDS files must be supplied to the program.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	None.
