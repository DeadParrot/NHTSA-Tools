PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	Ratio computes the ratio of UDS y-series files.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	Consistency checking is performed to warn the user if certain key
	fields are not the same in the input files. Some of the fields must be
	consistent or an error is generated. Other fields are blanked or set to
	zero if an inconsistency is present.

	The output array dimensions are the intersection of the input file
	ranges.

	The CURNAM is set to RAT. The default output file extension may be RAT
	or R followed by characters indicating the sensor attachment, if
	consistent.

	When both signals have a zero value at the same index point the ratio
	is set to one.  When only the denominator signal has a zero value the
	ratio is set to zero.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	Existing UDS y-series files must be supplied to the program.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	None.
