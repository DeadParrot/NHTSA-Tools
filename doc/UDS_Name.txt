			UDS File Naming Convention


This is a guideline for NHTSA UDS file naming.  These conventions are meant to
apply to raw and processed test data and generated (e.g., simulation) data.
The purpose of this guideline is to provide unique file names that are
indicative of the file contents.  Raw test data is uniquely named by the test
and curve numbers, so this guideline focuses on how to modify a UDS file name
after processing a single file and how to generate a UDS file name after
combining UDS files.

Only the most common data entities are shown.  In other cases, it is expected
that unique names should be available which maintain the basic naming
structure.  Alternative uses for some of the name substrings is reasonable for
special applications.  Newly identified entities which are frequently used will
be added to this list.

The philosophy of UDS file naming is that programs should avoid requiring input
files to have particular types of names, but that adhering to this structure
will simplify the user interface to UDS file data.  Where reasonable, programs
should generate default file names that follow this convention.
