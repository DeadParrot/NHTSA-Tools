PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	BWFilt performs two pass, zero phase shift, second order
	Butterworth filtering of UDS time series files.  Ten point
	tail averaging is used for the start-up.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	Default cutoff frequencies are provided based on current NHTSA
	filtering standards.

	Default output file names are provided using the current file
	naming conventions.

	BWFilt has been modified to provide -3 db at cutoff and to meet
	the J211 SAE standard (11/83).  This was accomplished by applying
	a 1.25 factor to the cutoff value in the FILTER subroutine.

	BWFilt has been modified to eliminate initial tail discontinuity
	for non-transient signals by using inverted, mirrored values for
	the appended initial portion.  The final tail treatment has also
	been improved with an inverted, mirrored extrapolation for the
	points used to start the second filtering pass.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing UDS y-series file must be supplied to the program.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	The general nature of this filter is that there is some distortion
	of the data tail values and integrals.  It is not recommended using
	BWFilt for filtering below 100 Hz if such quantitative accuracy is
	important.
