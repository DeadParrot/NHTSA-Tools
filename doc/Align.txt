PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	Align performs alignment of a signal to a reference signal.
	Either peak, minimum variance, or integral-based alignment can be
	performed.  The array tail indices can be optionally adjusted to
	match.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	A reference signal is used as the basis for aligning a comparison
	signal.  The user is given a choice of the alignment methods and
	Align performs the alignment.  Multiple comparison curves can be
	used with the same reference curve.

	The peak method simply aligns the time/x value at which the signals'
	largest magnitude value occurs.

	The RMS method finds the time/x shift that minimizes the
	root-mean-square (RMS) difference between the signals.  The shift is
	limited to a user-specified percent of the comparison signal span since
	the RMS value is based only on the portion of the signals that overlap.

	The integral-based method aligns the time/x value at which a specified
	percent of the signals' integral from x=0 to the end tail occurs.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing UDS file must be supplied to the program.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	None.
