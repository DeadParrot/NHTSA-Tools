AUTHOR:  S. Summers

PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	MADY2UDS converts the time history data from madymo runs into a NHTSA
	UDS files.  This program has been tested with the LINACC.DAT and the
	FORCES.DAT output files from MADYMO.  The output UDS file contains a
	location/measurement from the madymo data file.


PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	One MADYMO location/measurement is output per UDS file.  The user is
	prompted to specify which location and measurement should be output.
	The program will accept ranges and the * wildcard when specifying the
	locations/measurements to be output.  Using the * wildcard means that
	all the locations/measurements will be output.  If the the * wildcard is
	present anywhere on the input line, then all the locations/measurements
	will be output.

	There is currently a limit of 20 curves that can be converted in a
	single pass.  Additional curves can be processed by using multiple
	passes through the file.


SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	The user must supply the name of the MADYMO file, identify the location
	and measurement to be output, and supply the name of the output UDS
	file.


KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	The MADYMO data file must start with time zero.
