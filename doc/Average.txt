PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	Average computes the average of UDS y-series files.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	The output array dimensions are the intersection of the input file
	ranges.

	The CURNAM is set to AVG. The default output file extension may be AVG
	or A followed by characters indicating the sensor attachment, if
	consistent.

	A report file named average.rep is generated if the REP command line
	argument is used.
