AUTHOR:  Stuart G. Mentzer

PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	HIC36 finds the maximum 36 msec Head Injury Criterion (HIC) value of
	a head cg resultant acceleration time seies and the corresponding time
	interval. The HIC value is the integral of the acceleration (in G'S)
	to the 2.5 power divided by the time interval to the 1.5 power. The
	time interval is restricted in HIC36 to be at most 36 msec.

	HIC36 uses an efficient branch and bound algorithm which finds the
	global maximum while exploiting the monotonicities within the HIC
	function. HIC36 is an adaptation of HIC with the additional
	constraint on the time interval.

	See report DOT-HS-806-681 for a	description of the basic algorithm.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	A new version of the UDS file with the computed HIC value is output
	to the user's account if requested with the UPDATE command line
	argument.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing resultant time series must be supplied to the program.
	If the data isn't raw head cg acceleration a warning is produced.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	None.
