PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	RmBias performs bias removal on a signal using a user-specified
	percentage of the signal to determine the size of the bias. Once
	the portion of the signal to be used is specified RmBias uses an
	averaging algorithm to determine the average magnitude of the
	function over the interval. This average value is assumed to be the
	bias, and the signal is then corrected by subtracting this bias
	from each point on the signal.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	RmBias provides the option of determining the bias from either the
	start or end tails of the signal, as specified by the user.  Once the
	user specifies which method to use, RmBias prompts for what percentage
	of the signal to use in determining the bias.

	RmBias can process either Y or X-Y channel format data.  In both cases
	the bias is computed by averaging the y-axis data points over the
	specified span.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	Existing UDS files must be supplied to the program.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	As with any other signal correction algorithm that allows user control
	of the method, a reasonable sense of how much of the signal is useable
	for bias determination is required. Although using the entire signal is
	acceptable, this may not always produce the best results. Also, using
	too small a portion of the signal may also generate improper results,
	especially if the signal has not been filtered before bias
	determiniation - excess noise may lead to an inaccurate bias value.

	The use of tail averaging assures that the approximate first integral
	is zero over the bias-corrected tail for y-series channel data.  This
	does not hold for X-Y channel data.
