PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	FFT computes the Discrete Fourier Transform of UDS y-series files.
	The magnitude and phase can be output to UDS files.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	FFT pads the data out to a power of two length, usually beyond the
	next power of two above the signal length to give a finer frequency
	sampling rate.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing UDS file must be supplied to the program.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	For signals near the limit of the array size the normal zero-padding
	length may be limited, but will be at least up to the next power of
	two beyond the signal length.
