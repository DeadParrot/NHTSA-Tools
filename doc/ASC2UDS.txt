PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	ASC2UDS performs conversion of ASCII data files to UDS files.
	ASCII files with multiple numeric columns and a non-numeric header
	are supported.  The output UDS files can have Y or X-Y channel formats.
	An existing UDS file can be used to provide the base specifications,
	and the key UDS specification fields can be set/modified interactively.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	Input ASCII files are analyzed to find the first numeric record and
	the column structure of the numeric data.  A non-numeric header of
	any length will be automatically skipped over.  ASC2UDS expects
	numeric data in columns with the array index increasing by one for
	each file record.  Up to 99 columns per record can be accessed.

	The columns to use for the index, X, and Y data are specified by the
	user.  An X data column is used for X-Y channel UDS files or to
	compute the X data increment for Y channel files.  The index column
	can contain any floating point or integer data that is a scaled
	version of the data index, such as the evenly spaced X values of a Y
	channel signal.  If the index data contains sufficient precision
	ASC2UDS will determine the correct starting index and will check the
	index of subsequent records.  An NFP value can be specified instead
	of an index column to determine the starting data array index.  The
	same column can be used for more than one data set (e.g., the index
	column could also be the X data column for a Y channel file).

	For X-Y UDS files a linear formula of the form x = a*i + b can be
	used instead of X column data.

	Scaling can be performed on X and Y column data.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	Use UDSTool or UDSMod to set UDS specification fields that ASC2UDS
	does not set.
