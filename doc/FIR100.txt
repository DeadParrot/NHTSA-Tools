PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	FIR100 performs 100 Hz finite impulse response filtering of a UDS file
	containing a digitized time series.  FIR100 is general purpose in
	nature, but is used primarily to filter side impacted thoracic and
	pelvic signals.

	The program filters a signal using a four step process.  First, FIR100
	uses a four-pole, zero-phase Butterworth filter with a 300 Hz cutoff.
	This is done to prevent aliasing in the next step, subsampling to a
	1600 Hz sampling rate.  After the anti-aliasing filter, the signal is
	subsampled to exactly 1600 Hz.  (time between data samples = .000625
	seconds). This is the required sampling rate for FIR100 to filter to
	the correct frequencies.  At the user's option, any bias in the signal
	is next removed.  Finally, the finite impulse response filter is
	applied to the signal, and the signal is output in UDS format.

	The resulting passband frequency is 100 Hz, the cutoff frequency is 136
	Hz, the stopband frequency is 189 Hz, the passband ripple is 0.0225 dB,
	and the stopband gain is -50 dB.

	FIR100 started out life as the BIOPROC, and is the functional
	equivalent of BIOPROC.  However, FIR100 has been updated to include a
	more standard user interface (e.g. default output file names), NHTSA
	standardized filtering software subroutines, and numerous code
	modifications to enhance portability.  The BIAS, IIRFIL, and FIRF16
	subroutines were coded by M.R. Neale of VRTC.


PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	o  FIR100 provides the user with option to remove bias from the signal.


SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing UDS time series file must be supplied to the program.
