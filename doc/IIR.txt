PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	IIR is a programmable, n-th order, Butterworth, low-pass, recursive,
	infinite impulse response, bidirectional digital filter.  IIR determines
	which filters (1-,2-,3-, or 4-pole) to call in order to produce the
	desired n-pole filter.  IIR was adapted from the VRTC program IIRFIL
	developed by B. Stevens.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	IIR will prompt you for 3 values: frequency cutoff (Hz), attenuation (dB)
	at stop band frequency, and stop band frequency (Hz).  From these it will
	compute the number of poles according to this formula:
	
		# of poles = -FATT/(20.*LOG10(FSTP/FCUT)) + 0.5
	
		FATT - Frequency attenuation
		FSTP - Stop frequency
		FCUT - Cutoff frequency

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing UDS time series file must be supplied to the program.  All
	entered values must be real (fractions are truncated), and the frequency
	attenuation must be negative.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	IIR has been observed to move the initial signal tail by large amounts in
	some cases.

	BWFilt has a 25 percent higher cutoff frequency than IIR, therefore, if
	you want to duplicate the response of the BWFilt filter you must raise
	IIR's cutoff freq. by 25 percent.

	The following is a table that will let you duplicate the filtering process
	of BWFilt for these SAE classes:

		CLASS      FCUT     FATT     FSTP
		60        125      -40      395
		100        225      -40      712
		180        375      -40     1186
		600       1250      -40     3953
