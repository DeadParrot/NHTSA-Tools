PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	Shifts performs shifting of UDS file X or Y axis data by
	user-specified amounts.  This includes time-shifting time series
	signals (x-axis shift) and bias changes.  For x-axis shifts of
	y-series channels the data is shifted by the closest index, and the
	array tail indices can be optionally adjusted to match.  For other
	shifts the array data values are changed by the specified amounts.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing UDS file must be supplied to the program.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	None.
