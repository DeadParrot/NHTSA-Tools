PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	Diffr performs differentiation of UDS files using a centered
	difference formula that is suitable for a wide variety of signals.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	For y-series data Diffr uses a centered difference formula of the form:

	  y'(i) = ( y(i+1) - y(i-1) ) / ( 2 delta_x )

	with any appropriate units conversion factors.

	The tail points can't use a centered difference since data is only
	available on one side.  For the start tail Diffr uses a weighted
	average of the three point interpolation formula:

	  y'(i) = ( -3 y(i) + 4 y(i+1) - y(i+2) ) / ( 2 delta_x )

	and the linear extrapolation of the centered difference formula:

	  y'(i) = 2 y'(i+1) - y'(i+2)
	        = ( -2 y(i) + y(i+1) + 2 y(i+2) - y(i+3) ) / ( 2 delta_x )

	Taking 1/3 of the first formula plus 2/3 of the second gives the
	formula:

	  y'(i) = ( -7 y(i) + 6 y(i+1) + 3 y(i+2) - 2 y(i+3) ) / ( 6 delta_x )

	The end tail is based on the analogous symmetric formula.  This
	tail treatment works well for a wide variety of smooth and noisy
	signals.

	For x-y data Diffr uses the more general 3-point interpolation
	formula (which simplifies to the centered difference formuala
	for y-series).  The tail values are again based on the same
	weighted average of the three point interpolation and extrapolated
	centered difference formulas.  Special formulas are used for points
	where the x values change direction or where very small x increments
	would otherwise lead to serious roundoff errors.

	By default Diffr uses a formula-computed initial (x=0) value for the
	derivative signal.  The INI_VAL command line option tells Diffr to
	use a file specification value, if appropriate, (such as INIVEL) for
	the initial value.  Alternatively, a specific initial value can be
	entered with the INI_VAL=<value> form of the option.

	Metric, SI, and English dimensional units files are supported.


SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing UDS file must be supplied to the program.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	Numerical differentiation is always a noise amplifying process,
	and Diffr may produce noisy signals, especially if the data is
	somewhat noisy to begin with and/or if a second differentiation
	is performed.  The SimFil program may be a better tool for
	directly computing smooth derivatives.

	Diffr performs numerical differentiation of individual signals,
	which is not valid for obtaining angular velocity or acceleration
	from axial three-dimensional angular position signals.  There are
	a number of angular position representations (Euler angles,
	Bryant/Cardan angles, screw axis, quaternion), each of which
	has a distinct differentiation algorithm that uses angular position
	signals from all three axes.
