PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	Clip computes the maximum 3 msec clip value of a resultant chest
	acceleration time series.  The clip value is the largest value the
	signal equals or exceeds for at least a 3 msec contiguous time span.

	Clip also computes the Chest Severity Index (CSI) which is the integral
	of the acceleration values to the 2.5 power over the pulse time span
	from time zero to the end.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	The program checks that the file is a resultant time series and issues
	a warning if the data isn't chest acceleration or is not filtered at
	the standard 300 Hz cutoff.

	The clip value is computed based on the linearly interpolated input
	signal, and Clip can accept input signals with a time step that is not
	a divisor of 3 msec.  The input signal does not have to start at or
	before time zero but warnings are displayed if it does not.

	A report file named clip.rep is generated if the REP command line
	argument is used.

	A new version of the UDS file containing the computed Clip3M and CSI
	values will be optionally created by the program if the UPDATE
	command line option is used.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing UDS file containing a resultant time series (typically
	chest acceleration filtered to 300 Hz cutoff) must be supplied to the
	program.
