PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	Sum computes the sum of UDS y-series files.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	Consistency checking is performed to warn the user if certain key
	fields are not the same in the input files. Some of the fields must be
	consistent or an error is generated. Other fields are blanked or set to
	zero if an inconsistency is present.

	The output array dimensions are the intersection of the input file
	ranges.

	The CURNAM is set to SUM. The default output file extension may be SUM
	or S followed by characters indicating the sensor attachment, if
	consistent. LOAD CELL data will get a code indicating the row or
	column summed, if any, or SLT for "Sum of Loads - Total".

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	Existing UDS y-series files must be supplied to the program.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	None.
