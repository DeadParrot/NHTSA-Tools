PROGRAM FUNCTION AND METHODS:

	Integ performs integration of UDS time series and X-Y files.

	Trapezoid rule integration is used to provide reliable results for
	both raw (noisy) and filtered data.

PROGRAM FEATURES/OPTIONS:

	Any of the relevant integrals for a pulse can be computed without
	first computing intermediate integrals.  The FIRST, SECOND, or
	BOTH command line arguments can be optionally used to specify the
	desired outputs without answering program prompts.

	Initial values for integrals can be controlled by using the INI_VAL
	command line argument to Integ.  A default initial value of zero is
	used for all integrations except from acceleration to velocity,
	which uses the UDS INIVEL field value.

	Metric, SI, and English dimensional units files are supported.

SETUP/RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

	An existing UDS file must be supplied to the program.

KNOWN PROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS:

	Integ performs numerical integration of individual signals,
	which is not valid for obtaining three-dimensional angular position
	from angular velocity or acceleration signals.  There are a
	number of angular position representations (Euler angles,
	Bryant/Cardan angles, screw axis, quaternion), each of which
	has a distinct integration algorithm that uses angular velocity
	signals from all three axes.
